    <h2>What's Happening</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://features.propublica.org/driven-into-debt/chicago-ticket-debt-bankruptcy/" target="_blank">2018 study by WBEZ and ProPublica</a> found that black motorists are frequently forced into a spiral of crushing ticket debt and, often, Chapter 13 banruptcy in order to resolve that debt, restore their driver’s license to good standing, and free their vehicle from impoundment.
        Recently, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago have taken measures to allow motorists to regain driving privileges<sup><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tens-of-thousands-of-people-lost-drivers-licenses-over-unpaid-parking-tickets-now-theyre-getting-them-back" target="_blank">1</a></sup> provided their only offense is unpaid parking tickets; additionally, the city has paused the draconian debt collection measures<sup><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-temporary-halt-some-debt-collections-ticketing-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic" target="_blank">2</a></sup> that include garnishing state income tax rebates and forcing motorists to post thousands of dollars simply to enter into a repayment plan.
	</p>
	
    <h2>The Lose-Lose System</h2>
    <p>The city needs enforcement revenue (well over $200 million per year) to pay for public works and maintenance projects, but many motorists cannot afford to pay for a city sticker ($90.88–$144.33 per year) let alone violations for not purchasing the sticker ($200.00). Once a violation is accrued, late penalties can make repayment an impossibility. Hence, drivers lose their vehicle
        to impoundment where it accrues additional fees. The city collects no money, and city residents must rely on other means to get to work, drop their kids off at school, etc.</p>

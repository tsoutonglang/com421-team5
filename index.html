    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Take it to the Streets is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people contest and win appeals on parking violations in the city of Chicago. Our plan is to target residents who have been ticketed on a ward-by-ward basis in order to educate them on how to appeal and win in court.<br> We're the 41st ward's chapter of the organization.</p>

    <h2>The Issue</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://features.propublica.org/driven-into-debt/chicago-ticket-debt-bankruptcy/" target="_blank">2018 study by WBEZ and ProPublica</a> found that black motorists are frequently forced into a spiral of crushing ticket debt and, often, Chapter 13 banruptcy in order to resolve that debt, restore their driver’s license to good standing, and free their vehicle from impoundment.
        <br>Recently, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago have taken measures to allow motorists to regain driving privileges<sup><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tens-of-thousands-of-people-lost-drivers-licenses-over-unpaid-parking-tickets-now-theyre-getting-them-back" target="_blank">1</a></sup> provided their only offense is unpaid parking tickets; additionally, the city has paused the draconian debt collection measures<sup><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-temporary-halt-some-debt-collections-ticketing-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic" target="_blank">2</a></sup> that include garnishing state income tax rebates and forcing motorists to post thousands of dollars simply to enter into a repayment plan.

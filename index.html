        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Take it to the Streets is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people contest and win appeals on parking violations in the city of Chicago. 
            Our plan is to target residents who have been ticketed on a ward-by-ward basis in order to educate them on how to appeal and win in court. We're the 41st ward's chapter of the organization.
        </p>
        <p> Often times motorists feel intimidated by the appeals process and either pay their ticket (or, worse, ignore it) rather than attempt to argue their case in court.</p>
        <p>Our goals are to:
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li><i>Convince motorists who have been ticketed that they can fight their ticket and potentially win.</i></li>
                <li><i>Educate users on the types of violations most common in our ward and the types of allowable defenses that can be used during a hearing to argue their case.</i></li>
                <li><i>Present an organized list of information from the city of Chicago on how to schedule a hearing as well as give a template to follow and advice on how to can use rhetorical appeals to attempt to argue their case.</i></li>
            </ul>

        <h2>The Issue</h2>
        <p>A <a href="https://features.propublica.org/driven-into-debt/chicago-ticket-debt-bankruptcy/" target="_blank">2018 study by WBEZ and ProPublica</a> found that black motorists are frequently forced into a spiral of crushing ticket debt and, often, Chapter 13 banruptcy in order to resolve that debt, restore their driverâ€™s license to good standing, and free their vehicle from impoundment.
            Recently, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago have taken measures to allow motorists to regain driving privileges<sup><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tens-of-thousands-of-people-lost-drivers-licenses-over-unpaid-parking-tickets-now-theyre-getting-them-back" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> provided their only offense is unpaid parking tickets; additionally, the city has paused the draconian debt collection measures<sup><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-temporary-halt-some-debt-collections-ticketing-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup> that include garnishing state income tax rebates and forcing motorists to post thousands of dollars simply to enter into a repayment plan.

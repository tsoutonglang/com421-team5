    <h2 class="spaces">Contest Your Ticket!</h2>
    <p>Did you know that 3 out of 4 people in your area who have contested the ticket have avoided paying the ticket?<br>Just follow the steps provided below and you should be able to elaborate your argument to use in the court.</p>

    <h2 class="spaces">Before The Hearing</h2>
    <p>If you are certain that you did not violate any traffic-related offenses, then you can make your arguments based on facts, try not to be fancy, just tell the truth.</p>
    <p>If you violated the traffic rules because of some emergency, you can argue that you did what you did to avoid something. For example, you changed a traffic line abruptly because there is a hole in front of you that might damage your car.</p>
    <p>Another thing that you can do that might help with your argument is to go back to the violation scene, and collect any evidence that proves you were wrongly ticketed. Remember to print everything that you collected from the scene because you are not allowed to use electronic devices during the hearing.</p>
    <p>Do some research to see if anyone had a similar problem as you, and see what they did. Also, do some research to see what kind of <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/challenging_tickets/contesting_in_person.html" target="_blank">defenses</a> are more efficient, and use it for your argument.</p>
    <p>You can write down your speech before going to the court, but <i>do not</i> read it during the hearing. The speech you wrote is only there to guide you, you should not depend on it.</p>

    <h2 class="spaces">At The Hearing</h2>
    <p>One thing that might help you for the hearing is to show up to your court a little bit early with your notes, and be prepared to present your case.</p>
    <p>At this point, you know you have prepared yourself for this, so don't be nervous, take a deep breath if you need to. Remember that nothing bad is going to happen if you lose.</p>
    <p>Never lie or exaggerate the situation, if you get caught you are certainly going to lose.</p>
    <p>Remember at all times, refer to the judges as "Your Honor" with respect and deference.</p>
    <p>Approach your argument as a conversation with the judge, and when you are asked to stop, just stop or ask for permission to finish your answer, and make it quick. If the judge asks a "yes" or "no" question, just answer with "yes" or "no".</p>
